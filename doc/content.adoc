== Introduction

_CamToNES_ (Camera To Not-Empty Sequence) is command line interface for process
security camera videos for process motion and faces.

=== Rationale

I start writting this program because I need to review hours of security camera
videos and that's sounds really boring and time consuming. The main objetive is
to easy the task of reviewing static camera videos applying motion detection
through Background substracion

Here a incomplete list of things that _CamToNES_ aims to archieve:

* Have a simple interface to use OpenCV in for extract motion and faces from videos.
* Provide a simple way to tune the parameters for correctly detect relevant motion.
* Provide a simple way to realtime detection of movement and faces.

And _CamToNES_ goals are not:

* To be a fully feature interface to OpenCV.
* To provide an exaustive set of tune parameters.

=== Project Maturity

Since _CamToNES_ is a young project there can be some API breakage.


=== Dependencies

_CamToNES_ depends on OpenCV 3.0 and python >= 2.7.

=== Install

To use _CamToNES_ you can install it through pypi:

[source,bash]
----
pip install camtones
----

[[quickstart]]
== Quick Start

The best approach to start to understand how to process a video with _CamToNES_
is using the _motion_wizard_ command.

[source,bash]
----
camtones motion_wizard my_video_file.avi
----

You will see something like this:

.Motion Wizard
image::assets/motion-wizard.png[Motion Wizard]

The motion wizard allow you to "tune" the parameters used to extract the motion
sections from a video file.

=== Tunning

You can see the link:#tunning-parameters[Tunning Parameters] section to
understand better the porpose and the behavior of each paramter.

=== Running extraction

After ensure that you have tunned it correctly, you
can start to capture it in a new video file, or an .edl file.

This will have the same behavior if you run the _motion_extract_ or
_motion_extract_edl_ commands in the command line, with the parameters defined
in the wizard.

=== Reproducing extracted edl

If you extract the video to an edl file, you can reproduce it with, for
example, _mplayer_ with the next command:

[source,bash]
----
mplayer -edl my_video_file.avi.edl my_video_file.avi
----

The edl file will say _mplayer_ when have to jump to next position with motion
detected.

=== Motion detection/extraction

The motion extraction/detection get the images of a video, and process it to
detect changes between one frame and the previous. This approach, normally,
generate a lot of false positives because we are searching for big solid
objects in the camera, not small leafs moved by the wind.

For remove this false positive _CamToNES_ process the diferences image to
remove this false positive.  But the false positive can means diferent things
for different videos, this is the reason to need tunning the extraction.

==== The Process

To filter the image, _CamToNES_ follow the next process. Get a frame from the
video, resize it (if the user have define a link:#motion-resize[resize]
parameter), process it through a background extraction
link:#motion-algorithms[algorithm] (MOG2 or KNN). As result, we get a mask of
diferences between the background and the current frame.

After get the differences mask, we apply to this mask the
link:#motion-blur[blur] defined by the user.

After bluring the mask, we discard all grays, using the _threshold_ provided by
the user, this means, that every gray darker than the threshold will be black,
and every gray lighter than the threshold will be white.

Every white element remaining in the mask after this process will generate a
_rectangle_ result.

This rectangles are filtered by the _exclude_ parameter.

If a frame have a not-excluded rectangle, the frame is a motion frame, else, is
a static frame.

[[motion-resize]]
==== Resize

You can resize the image before processing with the _--resize_ option. This is
done for process the result faster or for discard some video imperfections.

The value must be a number of pixels of the new width of the frames.

[[motion-algorithms]]
==== Algorithms

You can defined with the _--subtractor_ parameter the algorithm to use, normally
MOG2 and KNN, but depends on your installation. You can see all supported
algorithms running _motion_detect_, _motion_extract_ or _motion_extract_edl_
with the _--help_ option.

The value must be one of the allowed options (normally MOG2 or KNN).

[[motion-blur]]
==== Blur

You can blur the mask to remove camera imperfections or irrelevant small
movments with the _--blur_ option.

The value must be a number of pixels.

[[motion-threshold]]
==== Threshold

You discard gray zones in the mask with the _--threshold_ option (this normally
combined with the blur allow to remove imperfections or small movementes). The
KNN and MOG2 algorithms detect shadows and assign the gray with value 127 to
the shadows.

The value must be a number between 0 and 255.

[[motion-exclude]]
==== Exclude

You can exclude result rectangles with the _--exclude_ option. This option
recive a python expresion that is evaluated to True or False. If the expression
evaluate to True, the rectangle is discarded.

The value must be a valid python expresion, and you will have access to the
variables _rect_ and _frame_.

The _rect_ variable will have the attributes x, y, width, height and area.

The _frame_ variable will have the attributes width, height and area.

You can use it, for example, to discard any movement with an area smallar than
10000 pixels with the next expression:

[source,python]
----
rect.area < 10000
----

=== Philosophy

Five most important rules:

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Readability counts.

All contributions to _CamToNES_ should keep these important rules in mind.
